# The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks with videos from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program).
As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the June 2021 batch.

## Tools/IDE : Python/Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook

## Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. </br>
<li>Dataset for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/Recdata/Data-Science-Bussiness-Analytics-Internship/blob/main/task%201/Task_1_TSF_Supervised_Learning_Prediction.ipynb">Task_1_Code</a>.</br>
<li>Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf1KU4G79fw&ab_channel=AmanNadeem">Task_1_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.


## Technical : Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
This will be implementing with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm.

Video for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf1KU4G79fw&ab_channel=AmanNadeem">Task_2_Video</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.
